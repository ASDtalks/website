## Lewes Old Grammar School (LOGS)

Matthew came to a staff inset day and spoke openly and articulately about his experience of school from the perspective of someone with autism.
He shared experiences that all the teachers recognised, and explained how he had felt faced with bullying, how he had perceived the demands of particular teachers, and what a difference small interventions made to him.

His talk was both moving and engaging, and left his audience with a completely new outlook. I think his work is quite ground breaking and I highly recommend him.

## Seaford Rotary Club

The guest at our meeting a few months ago was Matthew Swan who gave us a
powerful talk on Autism. Matthew is a 22 year old young man who is autistic and his slides and accompanying notes that followed provided an insight into his condition. The point of Matthew's presentation was to talk about autism as a whole, based on factual information and his own personal experience. His talk was received very well and was shown by the number of members and guests who were prompted to ask questions, all of which were answered with interest, insight and understanding. 

It is a condition most of us do not know nearly enough about and I would strongly recommend Matthew's talk to Groups, Organisations and schools.
